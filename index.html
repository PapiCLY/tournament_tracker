            <p>The Chirstian Kids basketball tournament has 5 rounds. Each round a child will have the opportunity to take 10 shots. 
                We will record the amount of shots made out of the 10 taken. Depending on the height of the basketball hoop, additional points will be awarded.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If height of rim is 8.5 feet or shorter, each shot made is worth 1 point.</li>
                    <li>If height of rim is 9 feet, each shot made is worth 2 points.</li>
                    <li>If height of rim is 9.5 feet, each shot made is worth 3 points.</li>
                    <li>If height of rim is 10 feet, each shot made is worth 4 points.</li>
                    <li>Considering Cai (The youngest) is only 5 years old and is not strong enough ye tot reach the rim at max height, each shot she makes is worth 4 points.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>At the end of the 5 rounds, we will enter the amount each player made along with the selected height to tally up the final scores and crown a winner!</p>
